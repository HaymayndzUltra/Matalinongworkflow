### PHASE 1: DEFINE TEST SCOPE AND CREATE TEST SKELETONS
- **Explanations:** 
  - Declare target files: `test_create_a_new_feature_for_user_authentication.py` and any needed integration test modules.
  - Establish directory layout and `pytest` discovery, create common fixtures (e.g., temp dirs, in-memory stores, fake config).
  - Decide mocking strategy (e.g., monkeypatch for functions, stub interfaces for services).
- **Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**
```bash
python3 todo_manager.py show <task_id Replace All>
python3 todo_manager.py done <task_id Replace All> 1
```
- **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Use `pytest` discovery conventions; fixture names and scopes must be explicit. No real network/DB/file I/O in unit tests—mock them. Keep skeletons minimal but runnable.

### PHASE 2: IMPLEMENT UNIT TESTS (AUTH FEATURE)
- **Explanations:** 
  - Cover all individual functions: credential validation, password hashing/verification, token/session issuance, input normalization, and error handling.
  - Include boundary/edge cases: empty/null credentials, unicode, extremely long inputs, invalid formats, timing/failure paths, lockout/backoff behavior if applicable.
  - Test both success and failure paths; isolate external effects with mocks/fixtures.
- **Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**
```bash
python3 todo_manager.py show <task_id Replace All>
python3 todo_manager.py done <task_id Replace All> 2
```
- **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Strict AAA pattern; each test must assert explicit outcomes (return values, exceptions, side-effect calls). Do not couple unit tests to integration layers.

### PHASE 3: IMPLEMENT INTEGRATION TESTS
- **Explanations:** 
  - Validate interactions with existing systems: persistence/state management, CLI flows, and file operations that the feature touches.
  - Use realistic wiring with controlled test doubles only where external systems are unavailable; ensure end-to-end auth paths are exercised.
  - Include CLI invocation tests and state transitions before/after authentication.
- **Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**
```bash
python3 todo_manager.py show <task_id Replace All>
python3 todo_manager.py done <task_id Replace All> 3
```
- **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Keep integration environment deterministic (seeded data, isolated temp dirs). Avoid flaky timing; prefer explicit synchronization over sleeps.

### PHASE 4: IMPLEMENT PERFORMANCE TESTS
- **Explanations:** 
  - Evaluate with large datasets (e.g., bulk user records), concurrent authentication attempts, and memory usage during bursts.
  - Measure throughput and latency; assert acceptable thresholds where defined, or at least capture metrics for baseline.
  - Probe for regressions under load; ensure no resource leaks.
- **Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**
```bash
python3 todo_manager.py show <task_id Replace All>
python3 todo_manager.py done <task_id Replace All> 4
```
- **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Keep performance tests isolated from unit/integration suites if they are slow; ensure they can be toggled (markers). Concurrency should use safe primitives; validate determinism of assertions.

### PHASE 5: CONSOLIDATE, RUN, AND VERIFY TEST SUITE
- **Explanations:** 
  - Run full test suite, ensure all pass; address flaky tests.
  - Ensure tests follow project standards and patterns; verify both success and failure paths are adequately covered.
  - Produce minimal documentation in test modules (docstrings) clarifying intent where non-obvious.
- **Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**
```bash
python3 todo_manager.py show <task_id Replace All>
python3 todo_manager.py done <task_id Replace All> 5
```
- **IMPORTANT NOTE:** No silent skips; any markers must be justified. Keep test names descriptive and outcomes reproducible.
