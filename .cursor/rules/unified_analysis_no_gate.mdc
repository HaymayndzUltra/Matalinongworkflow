## Unified Analysis & Iterative Search (No Gates)

Scope:
- Single source of truth for plan: `memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json`.
- The assistant may run arbitrary read/validate/search commands when `[exec:free:on]` is active; otherwise, default exec-policy applies.
- No file writes unless separately allowed by ingestion auto-write token.

Triggers:
- "Unified analysis and search"
- "Run unified analysis (no gate)"
- "Iterative analysis"

Behavior:
- For EACH phase in `tasks_active.json`, the assistant will:
  1) Read the phase intent (title/text). Use it as a search guide.
  2) Run targeted discovery/validation commands to find evidence (source scan, grep/rg, lint, service checks) consistent with the phase.
  3) Record Findings; if something is found or a hypothesis emerges, expand the search iteratively until no new signals appear.
  4) Mark the phase/subtask as logically complete (analysis perspective) only when no new relevant evidence is discovered under reasonable search expansions.
  5) Output a concise per-phase report: Evidence (paths/lines), Findings, Remaining gaps (if any), Verdict (DONE for analysis-only when saturation reached).

Global Sections:
- Cross-Phase Conflicts / Duplicates
- Verifier Checklist (ownership, dependencies, contracts, exclusivity, priority, collisions, traceability, boundaries, duplicates, policy contradictions)
- Gap Summary & Next Actions

Guardrails:
- No blocking gates; this rule never stops execution elsewhere.
- If `[exec:free:on]` is not set, only run read-only or whitelisted commands.
