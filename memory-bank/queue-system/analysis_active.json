List all detected issues explicitly.\nScope: Semantic/architectural review only; NOT runtime tests, syntax, or health checks. Cross-check applies both across this plan and against existing codebase/system logic.\n\nChecks:\n• Single ownership/authority (no double owners).\n• Correct dependency order (no circular/inverted prerequisites).\n• Consistent contract/schema.\n• Flags/gating not mutually exclusive when enabled.\n• No severity/priority overlap across phases.\n• Cross-phase collisions or missing referenced items.\n• Traceability to requirements is clear.\n• Well-defined boundaries/interfaces.\n• Tasks are complementary, not redundant.\n• Conceptual failure paths are clear.\n• Semantic duplicate scan (codebase-wide).\n• Policy contradiction checks.\n• Evidence requirement: list file paths/symbols/lines.\n\nLOGIC PARITY CHECK: Normalized signals/criteria/flows match plan meta; no duplicates of system prompts.\n\nDecision Gate: Proceed if no conflicts/duplicates and all analysis phases are complete.\n\nFindings:\n- Concern: setup_protocol_structure\n  Type: Overlap\n  Similarity: 0.60\n  Evidence:\n    - memory-bank/plan/organize.md:1-10 (Plan header)\n    - Why: Mirrors setup intent.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Analysis-only; no file writes in execution path; gate must be satisfied before side-effects.",
