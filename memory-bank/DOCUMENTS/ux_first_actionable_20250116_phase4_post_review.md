# Phase 4 Post-Review: OCR EXTRACTION WITH CONFIDENCE SCORES
**Task ID:** ux_first_actionable_20250116  
**Phase:** 4  
**Date:** 2025-01-16  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive OCR extraction system with field-level confidence scores and streaming event support for UX Requirement D, ensuring all extracted fields include confidence metrics and support real-time updates.

## Completed Components

### 1. Extraction Data Model
✅ Created complete extraction system:
- **FieldConfidence** dataclass with confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
- **ExtractionResult** dataclass with weighted overall confidence
- **ConfidenceLevel** enum (HIGH >0.85, MEDIUM 0.60-0.85, LOW <0.60)
- **DocumentField** enum with 12 standard fields
- **ExtractionEvent** enum for streaming events

### 2. Confidence Scoring System
✅ Implemented multi-level confidence:
- Field-level confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
- Confidence level categorization (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Weighted overall confidence calculation
- Critical field importance weighting
- Alternative values with confidence scores
- Bounding box tracking for each field

### 3. Streaming Events
✅ Full streaming support:
- **EXTRACT_START**: Extraction begins
- **EXTRACT_FIELD**: Single field extracted
- **EXTRACT_PROGRESS**: Progress updates (0-100%)
- **EXTRACT_RESULT**: Complete results
- **EXTRACT_ERROR**: Error handling
- Event callback mechanism
- Event storage in session (last 50 events)

### 4. Field Definitions
✅ Comprehensive field coverage:
- Personal: First/Middle/Last Name
- Identification: Document Number/Type
- Dates: Birth Date, Expiry Date
- Location: Address, Place of Birth
- Demographics: Sex, Civil Status, Nationality
- Localized field names (Tagalog/English)

### 5. Session Integration
✅ Full session state integration:
- `extraction_results` storage per side
- `extraction_events` list with limit
- `extraction_in_progress` flag
- Extraction timing events
- Summary generation for API responses

### 6. API Enhancement
✅ Complete API integration:
- Extraction triggered on successful capture
- Results included in burst_eval response
- Detailed field data with confidence
- Validation results included
- Summary and detailed views

## Extraction Features

### Confidence Calculation
- **Weighted Average**: Critical fields have higher weight
  - Document Number: 1.5x weight
  - Document Type: 1.3x weight
  - First/Last Name: 1.2x weight
  - Address: 0.6x weight
- **Overall Score**: Weighted average of all field confidences
- **Validation**: Automatic validation of results

### Streaming Architecture
```python
# Event flow
EXTRACT_START → EXTRACT_FIELD (×n) → EXTRACT_PROGRESS → EXTRACT_RESULT

# Event structure
{
    "type": "extract_field",
    "session_id": "xxx",
    "timestamp": 1234567890.123,
    "data": {
        "field": "first_name",
        "value": "JUAN",
        "confidence": 0.92,
        "level": "high"
    }
}
```

### Field Localization
| Field | English | Tagalog |
|-------|---------|---------|
| first_name | First Name | Unang Pangalan |
| last_name | Last Name | Apelyido |
| document_number | Document Number | Numero ng Dokumento |
| date_of_birth | Date Of Birth | Petsa ng Kapanganakan |

## Test Results
