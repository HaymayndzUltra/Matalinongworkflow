# Phase 5 Pre-Analysis: REAL-TIME STREAMING IMPLEMENTATION
**Task ID:** ux_first_actionable_20250116  
**Phase:** 5  
**Date:** 2025-01-16  
**Status:** ðŸ”„ Starting

## Objective
Implement real-time streaming for UX Requirement E, ensuring support for multiple concurrent sessions and real-time field updates as extraction progresses.

## Prerequisites
âœ… Phase 1: State machine (for state changes)
âœ… Phase 2: Timing metadata (for event timing)
âœ… Phase 3: Messages (for streaming updates)
âœ… Phase 4: Extraction events (for field updates)

## Key Requirements (IMPORTANT NOTE)
"Streaming must support multiple concurrent sessions and provide real-time field updates as extraction progresses."

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Streaming Infrastructure
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint
- WebSocket alternative support
- Event queue management
- Connection pooling

### 2. Event Types
- State transitions
- Quality updates
- Extraction progress
- Field results
- Error notifications
- Session lifecycle

### 3. Session Management
- Concurrent session tracking
- Session-specific streams
- Connection lifecycle
- Cleanup on disconnect

### 4. Real-time Updates
- Immediate state changes
- Progressive field extraction
- Quality gate notifications
- Capture progress

### 5. Performance Requirements
- < 10ms event latency
- Support 100+ concurrent sessions
- Automatic reconnection
- Event buffering

## Risk Assessment

### Risks
1. **Connection Management**: Many concurrent connections
2. **Memory Usage**: Event queues growing
3. **Network Issues**: Disconnections and reconnects
4. **Event Ordering**: Out-of-order delivery

### Mitigation
1. Connection pooling and limits
2. Event queue size limits
3. Automatic reconnection logic
4. Event sequence numbers

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create streaming module** (`streaming.py`)
   - StreamManager class
   - Event queue implementation
   - Connection management

2. **Add SSE endpoint**
   - `/face/stream/{session_id}`
   - Event formatting
   - Keep-alive handling

3. **Integrate with existing events**
   - State changes
   - Extraction events
   - Quality updates

4. **Add connection management**
   - Session registry
   - Cleanup handlers
   - Reconnection support

5. **Test concurrent sessions**
   - Multiple streams
   - Event isolation
   - Performance testing

## Success Criteria
- âœ… Multiple concurrent sessions supported
- âœ… Real-time field updates working
- âœ… < 10ms event latency
- âœ… Automatic reconnection
- âœ… Event ordering preserved
- âœ… Memory usage bounded

## Testing Strategy
- Concurrent session tests
- Event latency measurement
- Disconnection handling
- Memory leak testing
- Load testing (100+ sessions)

## Next Phase Dependencies
This phase enables:
- Phase 10: UX acceptance testing
- Phase 11: System integration
- Phase 13: Biometric integration
