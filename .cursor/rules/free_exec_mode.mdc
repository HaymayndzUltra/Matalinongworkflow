## Free Execution Mode (Token-Gated)

Activation Tokens (latest USER message wins; ignore inside code fences/quotes):
- Enable: `[exec:free:on]`
- Disable: `[exec:free:off]`

Behavior when enabled:
- The assistant MAY execute arbitrary shell commands needed to fulfill the plan, not limited to the default exec-policy whitelist.
- Intended for expert/operator-approved autonomous runs.

Safeguards:
- Defers to `rules_master_toggle.mdc` (master toggle highest precedence).
- No VCS operations (git) unless explicitly requested by the user in the same message.
- Prefer using plan-driven commands (from `tasks_active.json` fenced blocks). If absent, the assistant may run discovery/validation commands aligned to the phase intent.

Notes:
- When disabled or absent, the default exec-policy whitelist applies.
