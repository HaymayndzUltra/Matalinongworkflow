- **Organize by business features, not technical layers**
- Each feature is self-contained with all related components
- Promotes modularity, reusability, and better team collaboration
- Structure: `src/main/kotlin/com/company/app/features/{feature}/`
- Each feature contains: `models/`, `repositories/`, `services/`, `routes/`
- Common utilities in `common/` directory
- Configuration and DI in `config/` directory
- Test structure mirrors the feature-based organization
