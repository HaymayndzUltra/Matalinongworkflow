# Phase 14 Pre-Analysis: AUDIT EXPORT

## Phase Overview
**Phase:** 14 - AUDIT EXPORT
**Objective:** Implement WORM compliant audit log export with hash chain verification

## IMPORTANT NOTE Restatement
**From Plan:** "Verify tool passes; bundles are tamper-evident and signed; WORM links referenced in decision records."

This phase requires:
- WORM (Write Once Read Many) compliant JSONL bundles
- SHA-256 hash chain for tamper detection
- Verification script for bundle integrity
- Support for S3/GCS/local storage targets
- Signed bundles with manifest
- API returning signed bundle for time ranges

## Prerequisites Check
✅ Phase 13 (API Service) completed - audit/export endpoint defined
✅ Audit logger component exists from previous phases
✅ Hash chain implementation available
✅ Storage interfaces defined

## Key Components to Implement
1. **JSONL Bundle Generator**
   - Append-only log format
   - Structured audit records
   - PII redaction option

2. **Hash Chain Implementation**
   - SHA-256 sequential hashing
   - Previous hash embedded in each record
   - Chain verification algorithm

3. **Bundle Manifest**
   - Metadata about export
   - Hash chain root
   - Record count and time range
   - Digital signature

4. **Storage Targets**
   - Local filesystem
   - AWS S3 bucket
   - Google Cloud Storage
   - Azure Blob Storage

5. **Verification Tool**
   - Hash chain validator
   - Signature verification
   - Integrity checker
   - Tamper detection

## Risk Considerations
1. **Data Integrity Risks**
   - Hash collision (mitigated by SHA-256)
   - Chain breaks (validate on write)
   - Storage corruption (checksums)

2. **Performance Risks**
   - Large export volumes
   - Hash computation overhead
   - Network transfer delays

3. **Compliance Risks**
   - PII exposure in logs
   - Retention policy violations
   - Audit trail gaps

## Implementation Strategy
1. Design JSONL record schema
2. Implement hash chain generator
3. Create bundle manifest structure
4. Build storage adapters (S3, GCS, local)
5. Develop verification script
6. Test tamper detection
7. Validate WORM compliance

## Success Criteria
- Verification tool passes on all exports
- Hash chain unbroken for sequential records
- Tamper attempts detected and reported
- Bundles signed with verifiable signature
- WORM links included in decision records
- Export/import roundtrip successful

## Rollback Plan
If export fails or verification breaks:
1. Revert to previous audit logging
2. Queue failed exports for retry
3. Alert on integrity violations
4. Maintain local backup of critical logs

## Phase 14 Ready for Execution
All prerequisites met. Ready to implement WORM compliant audit export system.
