- **Standard Extension Structure**:
  - `Classes/`: Controller, Domain (Model/Repository), Service, EventListener, Middleware, Utility
  - `Configuration/`: TCA, Services.yaml, ext_localconf.php
  - `Resources/`: Private (templates, language files), Public (CSS, JS, images)
  - `Tests/`: Unit and Functional tests
  - `Documentation/`: Sphinx documentation

- Use proper MVC architecture with Extbase controllers
- Organize domain logic in Model and Repository classes
- Implement business logic in Service classes
- Use PSR-14 event listeners for extensibility
- Configure services properly in Services.yaml
