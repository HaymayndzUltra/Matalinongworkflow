# Phase 0 Pre-Analysis — kyc_bank_grade_parity_actionable_20250814

## Phase Context
**Phase 0: SETUP & PROTOCOL (READ FIRST)**

### Objectives
- Establish scope: Close gaps to reach fintech/bank-grade parity after Phase 22
- Define protocol for execution: No direct writes to queue/state files
- Set up environment variables and configuration management
- Establish timestamps ISO8601 +08:00 format
- Ensure reproducible runs with config-driven thresholds
- Set up read-only analyzers before marking phases done

## Current State Assessment
**Existing KYC System Status:**
- Base KYC verification system has 5/23 phases completed (21.7%)
- Phases 0-4 completed: Setup, Quality Analysis, Classification, Evidence Extraction, Forensics
- System architecture already includes modular components in `/workspace/KYC VERIFICATION/`
- Todo management system (`todo_manager.py`) is operational

**Bank-Grade Parity Gaps:**
- Missing PAD (Presentation Attack Detection) for anti-spoofing
- No NFC eMRTD authentication capabilities
- Philippine issuer adapters not yet implemented
- Risk model governance framework needed
- AML/PEP/Adverse media screening not integrated
- Transaction monitoring rules not established
- Human review console and case management missing
- Security hardening (encryption, tokenization) required
- Data retention and WORM compliance needed
- Observability infrastructure incomplete

## Prerequisites Check
- [x] todo_manager.py functional
- [x] ISO8601 +08:00 timezone handling in place
- [x] Python environment with required dependencies
- [x] Project structure established
- [ ] Environment variables template needed for bank-grade features
- [ ] Config-driven thresholds framework

## Expected Deliverables
1. Enhanced `.env.example` template with bank-grade parity variables
2. Configuration management framework for thresholds
3. Protocol documentation for phase execution
4. Read-only analyzer templates for validation
5. Gate documents structure for phase completion

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk:** Infrastructure already exists, extending current system
- **Medium Risk:** Coordination needed with existing KYC phases
- **Mitigation:** Clear separation between base KYC and bank-grade parity enhancements

## Success Criteria
- All environment variables documented
- Config-driven threshold system operational
- Protocol clearly defined and documented
- Phase gating mechanism established
- SLO targets defined (decision p50<20s, p95<60s)
- ≥99.9% availability architecture documented

## Next Steps
1. Create enhanced environment configuration
2. Set up config-driven threshold framework
3. Document phase execution protocol
4. Prepare read-only analyzers
5. Validate against IMPORTANT NOTE requirements
