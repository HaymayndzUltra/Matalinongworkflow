# Core Principles

## Core Principles

- Write straightforward, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns
- Use strong typing and avoid 'any'
- Restate what the objective is of what you are being asked to change clearly in a short summary.
- Utilize Lodash, 'Promise.all()', and other standard techniques to optimize performance when working with large datasets
