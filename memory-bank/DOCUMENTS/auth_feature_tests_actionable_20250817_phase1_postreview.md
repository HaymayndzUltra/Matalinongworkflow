# Post-Review â€” Phase 1 (Task: auth_feature_tests_actionable_20250817)

Validated gates. IMPORTANT NOTE satisfied:
- pytest discovery conventions honored.
- Explicit fixtures/scopes.
- No real network/DB/file I/O in unit tests; all mocked.
- Skeletons minimal and runnable.

Artifacts prepared: test file names and fixture scaffold.
