- `@export` decorator defines public functions callable by any user or contract
- `@construct` decorator defines initialization function executed once at submission (optional)
- Functions without decorators are private and only callable by contract itself
- Functions with `@export` can call private functions internally
- Optional arguments can be provided to `@construct` function
- Initial state can be setup using constructor arguments
- Use proper error handling and validation in exported functions
