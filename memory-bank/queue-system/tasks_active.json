Use read-only analyzers to verify structure before execution. All state changes use todo_manager.py.\n\n**Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**\n```bash\npython3 todo_manager.py show <TASK_ID>\npython3 todo_manager.py done <TASK_ID> 0\n```\nIMPORTANT NOTE: [SYNTHESIZED FROM ORGANIZER] No direct writes to queue/state files by agent; operator/system will place JSON into memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json. Timestamps use ISO8601 with +08:00. Validate with python3 plan_next.py and python3 plain_hier.py <TASK_ID> before any execution.",

Verification: run agent startup tests to confirm error handling works.\n\n**Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**\n```bash\npython3 todo_manager.py show <TASK_ID>\npython3 todo_manager.py done <TASK_ID> 1\n```\nIMPORTANT NOTE: [SYNTHESIZED FROM ORGANIZER] Keep change minimal (fix only).

Week 2: add leader election via distributed locks. Verification: simulate SystemDigitalTwin failures; discovery continues.\n\n**Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**\n```bash\npython3 todo_manager.py show <TASK_ID>\npython3 todo_manager.py done <TASK_ID> 2\n```\nIMPORTANT NOTE: [SYNTHESIZED FROM ORGANIZER] Use env-configurable Redis (no hardcoded hosts).
