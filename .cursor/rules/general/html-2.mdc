# HTML

## HTML
* Use semantic HTML.
* Use modern HTML features where appropriate, e.g., use `<details>` and `<summary>` over JS to show and hide content.
* Use `CamelCase` for IDs. When appending a block or section ID, append `-{{ block.id }}` or `-{{ section.id }}` respectively.

### Accessibility
* Ensure all interactive elements are focusable. e.g., if you use a label to style a checkbox, include `tabindex="0"`.
* Only use `tabindex="0"` unless absolutely necessary, to avoid hijacking tab flow.
