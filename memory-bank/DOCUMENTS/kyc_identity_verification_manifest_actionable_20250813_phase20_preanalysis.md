# Phase 20 Pre-Analysis â€” DOCUMENTATION
Task: kyc_identity_verification_manifest_actionable_20250813
Timestamp: 2025-08-14T14:47:17+08:00

## Objective
Prepare comprehensive documentation: repo setup/run, configs and KPIs, dashboards/SLOs, failover patterns, reviewer SOPs, data minimization & retention; plus on-call runbook and governance.

## IMPORTANT NOTE (from plan)
Governance includes registry/lineage/canary/sign-off and fairness audit cadence.

## Scope & Structure
- docs/README.md
  - Setup (venv, datasets), running CLIs (`run_pipeline.py`, `bench_metrics.py`, etc.), config references (policy_pack.yaml, vendors.yaml, issuer templates), KPIs (TPR/FNR/FPR), dashboards and SLOs, failover patterns, reviewer SOPs, data minimization & retention notes.
- docs/RUNBOOK_oncall.md
  - Alerts, SLOs, escalation, breaker states & recovery, failover drills (`failover_sim.py`), common incidents and mitigations.
- docs/GOVERNANCE.md
  - Model registry & lineage, canary process, sign-off gates, fairness audit cadence, retraining schedule, change management, audit trails.

## Inputs
- Existing scripts and artifacts under `KYC VERIFICATION/scripts/` and `artifacts/`.
- Metrics from `bench_metrics.py`; pipeline behaviors from Phase 18 smoke test.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Drift/fairness sections require clear cadence: propose monthly fairness audit and quarterly drift assessment.
- Ensure no PII in docs; use synthetic examples only.

## Deliverables
- Three docs under `docs/` as outlined above, with links to CLI usage and examples.

## Next Step
Draft `docs/README.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK_oncall.md`, and `docs/GOVERNANCE.md` with the above structure; validate against IMPORTANT NOTE before marking Phase 20 done.
