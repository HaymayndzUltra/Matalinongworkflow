- **Application Logic Design**:
  1. Route handlers: Handle requests/responses only
  2. Services: Contain business logic, call repositories
  3. Repositories: Handle database operations
  4. Entity classes: Data classes for database models
  5. DTOs: Data transfer between layers

- Use Repository Pattern with interfaces for testability
- Implement Service Layer for business logic separation
- Use dependency injection with Koin for loose coupling
- Apply proper error handling and exception management
