  - `python3 plan_next.py` (read-only)
  - Producing JSON content for `tasks_active.json` (agent output only; no direct file writes)
  - Conditional auto-write (ingestion artifacts only) when `[ingest:auto_write:on]` is present:
    - Write `memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json`
    - Write `memory-bank/queue-system/analysis_active.json`
- Forbidden:
  - Editing `memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json` directly (unless token-enabled as above)
  - Queue transitions or priority changes
  - Running arbitrary commands unrelated to the current phase

## POST-ACTION SUGGESTION POLICY (REQUIRED)
- After each allowed command is executed (validate/show/exec/done), the assistant MUST suggest the next best trigger, per `next_action_suggestions.mdc`.
- Suggestions must be concrete commands, not prose.
