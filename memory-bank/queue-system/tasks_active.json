        "text": "PHASE 0: SETUP & PROTOCOL (READ FIRST)\n\n**Explanations:** This phase establishes the critical pre-integration backup and preparation steps. Before any integration work begins, we must secure the existing face modules, document current endpoints, and establish a baseline for rollback capability. This is non-negotiable for production safety.\n\n**Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**\n```bash\npython3 todo_manager.py show kyc_integration_actionable_20250116\npython3 todo_manager.py done kyc_integration_actionable_20250116 0\n```\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT skip this phase under any circumstances. The backup created here is your only rollback mechanism if integration issues arise. Verify backup integrity before proceeding.",

        "text": "PHASE 1: SYSTEM ANALYSIS & MAPPING\n\n**Explanations:** Map the exact overlaps and dependencies between existing KYC modules (face_matcher, pad_detector, evidence_extractor) and new face scan modules (session_manager, challenge_generator, burst_processor). Create a comprehensive dependency graph and feature overlap matrix to drive all subsequent integration decisions.\n\n**Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**\n```bash\npython3 todo_manager.py show kyc_integration_actionable_20250116\npython3 todo_manager.py done kyc_integration_actionable_20250116 1\n```\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This analysis phase is critical - it identifies which modules to merge, which to keep separate, and which are entirely new contributions. Document all findings in the module comparison matrix.",

      },
      {
        "text": "PHASE 2: DEDUPLICATION STRATEGY\n\n**Explanations:** Intelligently merge duplicate functionality while preserving unique features. Combine PAD detection modules (pad_detector.py + pad_scorer.py), consolidate face analysis (geometry.py + quality_analyzer.py), and unify metrics collection. Maintain ISO 30107-3 compliance while adding texture/frequency analysis capabilities.\n\n**Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**\n```bash\npython3 todo_manager.py show kyc_integration_actionable_20250116\npython3 todo_manager.py done kyc_integration_actionable_20250116 2\n```\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Preserve the best features from both implementations.

      {
        "text": "PHASE 3: OCR/EXTRACTION INTEGRATION\n\n**Explanations:** Connect the existing OCR capabilities (evidence_extractor.py) with the face scan flow. Enhance the extractor with confidence scoring per field, create streaming updates for real-time feedback, and integrate extraction into the burst evaluation pipeline for back-side document processing.\n\n**Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**\n```bash\npython3 todo_manager.py show kyc_integration_actionable_20250116\npython3 todo_manager.py done kyc_integration_actionable_20250116 3\n```\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This phase directly addresses the OCR gap identified in UX requirements.
