**Task ID:** ux_first_actionable_20250116  
**Phase:** 13  
**Date:** 2025-01-16  
**Status:** ðŸ”„ Starting

## Objective
Integrate existing biometric components (face matching, PAD detection) and extraction systems with the UX-enhanced implementation, ensuring accuracy targets are maintained while supporting all UX flows.

## Prerequisites
âœ… Phase 12: Telemetry consolidation completed
âœ… UX-enhanced systems operational
âœ… State machine and quality gates in place
âœ… Extraction with confidence scores implemented

## Key Requirements (IMPORTANT NOTE)
"Biometric integration must maintain accuracy targets while supporting all UX flows."

## Integration Targets

### 1. Face Matcher Integration
**Current State:**
- `biometrics/face_matcher.py` - Standalone face matching
- `face/burst_processor.py` - UX-integrated burst processing
- Separate workflows

**Target State:**
- Face matcher integrated into state machine
- Matching occurs at appropriate state transitions
- Results included in quality gates
- Confidence scores in extraction

### 2. PAD Detection Enhancement
**Current State:**
- `liveness/pad_detector.py` - Legacy PAD detection
- `face/pad_scorer.py` - UX-enhanced PAD scoring
- Duplicate functionality

**Target State:**
- Unified PAD system
- Integrated with quality gates
- Real-time PAD scoring during capture
- Cancel-on-attack detection

### 3. Extraction Pipeline Unification
**Current State:**
- `face/extraction.py` - UX with confidence scores
- `extraction/evidence_extractor.py` - Legacy basic OCR
- Multiple extraction paths

**Target State:**
- Single extraction pipeline
- All extractions include confidence
- Streaming events for all OCR
- Unified field definitions

### 4. Biometric Event Integration
**Current State:**
- Biometric events separate from UX flow
- No real-time biometric feedback
- Limited telemetry

**Target State:**
- Biometric events in UX telemetry
- Real-time matching feedback
- PAD scores in quality updates
- Complete biometric tracking

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Face Matcher Integration
1. Add face matching to burst evaluation
2. Include match scores in quality gates
3. Add state transition on match success/failure
4. Stream matching progress events

### Step 2: PAD Detection Unification
1. Merge pad_detector.py with pad_scorer.py
2. Add PAD checks to quality gates
3. Implement instant cancel on attack detection
4. Add PAD telemetry events

### Step 3: Extraction Adapter Creation
1. Create adapter for evidence_extractor.py
2. Wrap legacy extraction with confidence scoring
3. Add streaming events to legacy extraction
4. Standardize field mappings

### Step 4: Biometric Telemetry
1. Add biometric event types to ux_telemetry
2. Track matching attempts and results
3. Record PAD detection events
4. Include biometric metrics in performance

## Accuracy Targets
Must maintain or exceed:
- **Face Matching**: 
  - FAR: < 0.1%
  - FRR: < 1.0%
  - Match time: < 500ms
  
- **PAD Detection**:
  - APCER: < 2.5%
  - BPCER: < 2.5%
  - Detection time: < 100ms
  
- **Extraction Accuracy**:
  - Field accuracy: > 95%
  - Confidence threshold: 0.85
  - Processing time: < 2s

## Integration Points

### State Machine Integration
```
CAPTURED â†’ [Face Matching] â†’ CONFIRM/REJECT
LOCKED â†’ [PAD Check] â†’ COUNTDOWN/SEARCHING
CAPTURED â†’ [Extraction] â†’ COMPLETE
```

### Quality Gate Integration
- Add match_score to quality metrics
- Include pad_score in stability checks
- Use extraction confidence in approval

### Streaming Integration
- Emit MATCH_START/MATCH_RESULT events
- Stream PAD_CHECK/PAD_RESULT events
- Continue extraction streaming

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Accuracy degradation**: Extensive testing required
- **Performance impact**: Monitor latencies
- **Breaking changes**: Use adapters

### Medium Risk
- **State machine complexity**: Clear state definitions
- **Event ordering**: Proper sequencing
- **Timeout handling**: Appropriate limits

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive accuracy testing
- Performance benchmarks before/after
- Feature flags for rollback
- Parallel processing where possible

## Success Criteria
- âœ… Face matcher integrated with state machine
- âœ… PAD detection unified and enhanced
- âœ… Single extraction pipeline
- âœ… All accuracy targets maintained
- âœ… No performance degradation
- âœ… Complete biometric telemetry
- âœ… All tests passing

## Testing Plan
1. Unit tests for each integration
2. Accuracy validation tests
3. Performance benchmarks
4. End-to-end flow tests
5. Stress testing with concurrent sessions

- Face Matcher Integration: 3 hours
- PAD Detection Unification: 2 hours
- Extraction Adapter: 2 hours
- Biometric Telemetry: 1 hour
- Testing & Validation: 2 hours
- **Total: ~10 hours**
