## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes in v2.0.0
1. **API Endpoints**: All v1 endpoints deprecated, use v2
2. **Parameter Names**: Changed from camelCase to snake_case
3. **Response Format**: New standardized structure

### Upgrade Path
1. Review [Migration Guide](docs/migration-guide.md)
2. Update API calls to v2 endpoints
3. Implement response adapters if needed
4. Test in staging environment
5. Deploy with feature flags

### Rollback Procedure
1. Set `KYC_API_VERSION=v1` environment variable
2. V1 endpoints remain available until 2025-07-16
