PHASE 1 Pre-Analysis â€” IDENTITY CAPTURE FOUNDATIONS

Scope
- Guided capture (web/mobile), glare/blur/orientation checks, multi-frame burst.
- Inputs: ID front/back, passport MRZ, selfie video for liveness (active/passive).

IMPORTANT NOTE (from plan)
- IC1: >95% pass at 1000px width; orientation auto-correct; quality scores in [0..1].
- IC2: MIME/type validation; size/duration limits enforced for all inputs.

Risks & Prereqs
- Device/browser variability affecting camera APIs; mitigate via constraints and fallbacks.
- Quality scoring calibration; need baseline datasets and thresholds.
- Privacy handling for captured media; storage and retention policies.

Next Steps
- Define input schemas and validation rules.
- Prototype capture UI/SDK hooks and quality/orientation checks.
- Establish test dataset and acceptance metrics tracking.
