# Phase 13 Post-Review: API SERVICE (FASTAPI)

## Completion Summary
**Date:** 2025-01-14
**Phase:** 13 - API SERVICE (FASTAPI)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. API Structure Implementation
- Created complete FastAPI application structure in `src/api/`
- Set up application with proper middleware (CORS, request ID, timing)
- Configured OpenAPI documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc

### 2. Contract Definitions
- Defined all Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Created comprehensive contracts for all endpoints
- Added proper examples in schema definitions
- Implemented ISO8601 timestamp handling with +08:00 timezone

### 3. Endpoint Implementation
Successfully implemented all required endpoints:

#### Core Endpoints
- **POST /validate** - Document validation with quality assessment
- **POST /extract** - OCR/MRZ/Barcode data extraction
- **POST /score** - Risk scoring aggregation
- **POST /decide** - Decision engine with policy application

#### Specialized Endpoints
- **POST /issuer/verify** - Issuer verification with proof generation
- **POST /aml/screen** - AML/sanctions screening
- **POST /audit/export** - Audit log export with hash chain
- **POST /compliance/generate** - Compliance artifact generation

#### Health & Monitoring
- **GET /health** - Service health status
- **GET /ready** - Readiness check with dependency status
- **GET /metrics** - System metrics exposure

#### Complete Flow
- **POST /complete** - End-to-end KYC verification in single call

### 4. Supporting Files Created
- `contracts.py` - All Pydantic models and enums
- `app.py` - Main FastAPI application with all endpoints
- `examples.py` - API client examples and usage demonstrations
- `run_api.py` - Server launcher script
- `test_api.py` - Comprehensive endpoint tests

## IMPORTANT NOTE Validation
✅ **"Endpoints follow JSON contracts with examples"**
- All endpoints have properly defined Pydantic models
- JSON contracts include schema examples
- OpenAPI spec generated automatically with examples

✅ **"/metrics exposes orchestrator and pipeline metrics"**
- /metrics endpoint implemented
- Returns system metrics, vendor availability, component status
- Includes performance metrics (latency, error rates, throughput)

## Verification Steps Completed
1. All endpoints respond with proper JSON structure
2. Request/response validation working via Pydantic
3. OpenAPI documentation accessible at /docs and /redoc
4. Health check endpoints operational
5. Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
6. Middleware for request tracking and timing

## Files Modified/Created
- `/workspace/KYC VERIFICATION/src/api/__init__.py`
- `/workspace/KYC VERIFICATION/src/api/contracts.py`
- `/workspace/KYC VERIFICATION/src/api/app.py`
- `/workspace/KYC VERIFICATION/src/api/examples.py`
- `/workspace/KYC VERIFICATION/run_api.py`
- `/workspace/KYC VERIFICATION/tests/test_api.py`

## Key Design Decisions
1. Used singleton pattern for component initialization
2. Implemented proper timezone handling (Philippines UTC+8)
3. Added request ID and timing middleware for observability
4. Created comprehensive error handling with custom exception handlers
5. Provided both individual endpoints and complete flow endpoint

## Testing & Validation
- Created comprehensive test suite covering all endpoints
- Verified contract validation with invalid requests
- Tested health check and monitoring endpoints
- Confirmed OpenAPI spec includes all required paths

## Next Steps
Phase 13 is now complete. The API service is fully implemented with all required endpoints following JSON contracts and exposing metrics as specified.
