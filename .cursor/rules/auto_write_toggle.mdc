## Controlled Auto-Write Toggle (Ingestion Artifacts Only)

Token-gated allowance for the agent to write plan artifacts directly to the queue-system when explicitly requested.

### Activation Tokens (latest USER message wins; ignored in code fences/quotes)
- Enable auto-write: `[ingest:auto_write:on]`
- Disable auto-write: `[ingest:auto_write:off]`

### Scope (when enabled)
- Allowed writes by the agent:
  - `memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json`
  - `memory-bank/queue-system/analysis_active.json`
- Prohibitions remain:
  - No other files in `memory-bank/queue-system/` may be written
  - No VCS operations (git add/commit/push)
  - No execution side-effects outside the existing exec-policy

### Precedence & Safety
- Defers to `rules_master_toggle.mdc`; master toggle may disable all rules.
- Organizer authority remains; ingestion sources must be derived from `memory-bank/plan/organize.md`.
- If both enable and disable tokens appear, the right-most wins.

### Operational Notes
- If token is ON, ingestion flows may auto-write the generated JSON without operator paste.
- If token is OFF or absent, ingestion remains content-only output (operator paste required).
