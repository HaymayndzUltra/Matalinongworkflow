# Phase 20 Post-Review — DOCUMENTATION
Task: kyc_identity_verification_manifest_actionable_20250813
Timestamp: 2025-08-14T16:09:56+08:00

## Summary
Created the documentation set under `docs/` to cover setup, CLIs, KPIs, failover patterns, reviewer SOPs, data minimization/retention, on-call operations, and governance (registry, lineage, canary, sign-off, fairness cadence).

## Artifacts Produced
- `docs/README.md` — Environment setup, datasets, CLI usage (`run_pipeline.py`, `bench_metrics.py`, `vendor_healthcheck.py`, `failover_sim.py`, `generate_artifacts.py`, `redact_dataset.py`), configuration pointers, KPIs, failover overview, reviewer SOP, minimization & retention notes.
- `docs/RUNBOOK_oncall.md` — SLO targets (p50/p95 latency, availability), alerts, breaker state transitions, diagnostics commands, incident response, escalation, change management.
- `docs/GOVERNANCE.md` — Model registry & lineage metadata, canary rollout stages/guardrails, sign-off gates (ML/Platform/Compliance), fairness audit cadence, retraining & drift, change management, audit trails.

## Acceptance Check vs IMPORTANT NOTE
IMPORTANT NOTE (Phase 20): "Governance includes registry/lineage/canary/sign-off and fairness audit cadence."

- Governance: ✅ Documented in `docs/GOVERNANCE.md` with explicit sections and processes.
- Registry/Lineage: ✅ Required fields and lineage links specified.
- Canary/Sign-off: ✅ Staged rollout and approvals detailed with rollback policy.
- Fairness cadence: ✅ Monthly audits defined with parity checks and tracking.

Conclusion: Phase 20 IMPORTANT NOTE satisfied.

## References & Examples
- Benchmarks export CSV (+08:00 timestamps) via `scripts/bench_metrics.py`
- Failover drills via `scripts/failover_sim.py`; health via `scripts/vendor_healthcheck.py`
- Compliance artifacts via `scripts/generate_artifacts.py`

## Risks / Follow-ups
- Ensure no PII leaks in examples; continue using synthetic datasets.
- As API service evolves, keep health endpoints and runbook sections updated.

## Next Steps (Phase 21 — DOCKER & DEV TOOLING)
- Prepare Dockerfile (GPU-optional), docker-compose with healthchecks (/ready, /live), resource limits, tmpfs for PII staging.
- Provide `.env.example`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (formatting, ruff/mypy, secret scanning), and `Makefile` targets for dev/test/bench/compose/artifacts.
