# Pre-Analysis â€” Phase 2 (Task: auth_feature_tests_actionable_20250817)

Restating Phase 2 IMPORTANT NOTE and scope:
- Strict AAA pattern per test.
- Assert explicit outcomes (returns, exceptions, side-effects).
- No coupling to integration layers.

Risks & prerequisites:
- Identify all auth functions and inputs.
- Define negative/edge cases.
- Prepare mocks for external calls.
